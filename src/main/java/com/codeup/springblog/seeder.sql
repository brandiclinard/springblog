    ("On the Road", "Jack Kerouac", "In the winter of 1947, the reckless and joyous Dean Moriarty, fresh out of another stint in jail and newly married, comes to New York City and meets Sal Paradise, a young writer with an intellectual group of friends, among them the poet Carlo Marx. Dean fascinates Sal, and their friendship begins three years of restless journeys back and forth across the country. With a combination of bus rides and adventurous hitchhiking escapades, Sal goes to his much-dreamed-of west to join Dean and more friends in Denver, and then continues west by himself, working as a fieldworker in California for awhile, among other things. The next year, Dean comes east to Sal again, foiling Sal''s stable life once more, and they drive west together, with more crazy adventures on the way at Bull Lee''s in New Orleans, ending in San Francisco this time. The winter after that, Sal goes to Dean, and they blaze across the country together in friendly fashion, and Dean settles in New York for awhile. In the spring, Sal goes to Denver alone, but Dean soon joins him and they go south all the way to Mexico City this time.

Through all of this constant movement, there is an array of colorful characters, shifting landscapes, dramas, and personal development. Dean, a big womanizer, will have three wives and four children in the course of these three years. Perceptive Sal, who at the beginning is weakened and depressed, gains in joy and confidence and finds love at the end. At first Sal is intrigued by Dean because Dean seems to have the active, impulsive passion that Sal lacks, but they turn out to have a lot more in common. The story is in the details.", "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7e4cbd_3dea347612d0448d84c1f6ccf5cde7a6.jpg/v1/fill/w_334,h_514,al_c,lg_1,q_80/7e4cbd_3dea347612d0448d84c1f6ccf5cde7a6.webp"),
    ("The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn", "Mark Twain",
     "Consisting of 43 chapters, the novel begins with Huck Finn introducing himself as someone readers might have heard of in the past. Readers learn that the practical Huck has become rich from his last adventure withTom Sawyer (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) and that the Widow Douglas and her sister, Miss Watson, have taken Huck into their home in order to try and teach him religion and proper manners. Instead of obeying his guardians, however, Huck sneaks out of the house at night to join Tom Sawyer''s gang and pretend that they are robbers and pirates.

One day Huck discovers that his father, Pap Finn, has returned to town. Because Pap has a history of violence and drunkenness, Huck is worried about Pap''s intentions, especially toward his invested money. When Pap confronts Huck and warns him to quit school and stop trying to better himself, Huck continues to attend school just to spite Pap. Huck''s fears are soon realized when Pap kidnaps him and takes him across the Mississippi River to a small cabin on the Illinois shore.

Although Huck becomes somewhat comfortable with his life free from religion and school, Pap''s beatings become too severe, and Huck fakes his own murder and escapes down the Mississippi. Huck lands a few miles down at Jackson''s Island, and there he stumbles across Miss Watson''s slave, Jim, who has run away for fear he will be sold down the river.

Huck and Jim soon learn that men are coming to search Jackson''s Island, and the two fugitives escape down the river on a raft. Jim''s plan is to reach the Illinois town of Cairo, and from there, he can take the Ohio River up to the free states. The plan troubles Huck and his conscience. However, Huck continues to stay with Jim as they travel, despite his belief that he is breaking all of society and religion''s tenets. Huck''s struggle with the concept of slavery and Jim''s freedom continues throughout the novel.

Huck and Jim encounter several characters during their flight, including a band of robbers aboard a wrecked steamboat and two Southern "genteel" families who are involved in a bloody feud. The only time that Huck and Jim feel that they are truly free is when they are aboard the raft. This freedom and tranquility are shattered by the arrival of the duke and the king, who commandeer the raft and force Huck and Jim to stop at various river towns in order to perform confidence scams on the inhabitants. The scams are harmless until the duke and the king pose as English brothers and plot to steal a family''s entire inheritance. Before the duke and the king can complete their plan, the real brothers arrive. In the subsequent confusion, Huck and Jim escape and are soon joined by the duke and the king.

Disappointed at their lack of income, the duke and the king betray Huck and Jim, and sell Jim back into slavery. When Huck goes to find Jim, he discovers that Jim is being held captive on Silas and Sally Phelps'' farm. The Phelps think Huck is their visiting nephew, Tom Sawyer, and Huck easily falls into the role of Tom. Tom Sawyer soon arrives and, after Huck explains Jim''s captivity, Tom takes on the guise of his own brother, Sid. After dismissing Huck''s practical method of escape, Tom suggests they concoct an elaborate plan to free Jim. Tom''s plan is haphazardly based on several of the prison and adventure novels he has read, and the simple act of freeing Jim becomes a complicated farce with rope ladders, snakes, and mysterious messages.

When the escape finally takes place, a pursuing farmer shoots Tom in the calf. Because Jim will not leave the injured Tom, Jim is again recaptured and taken back to the Phelps farm. At the farm, Tom reveals the entire scheme to Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas. Readers learn that Miss Watson has passed away and freed Jim in her will, and Tom has been aware of Jim''s freedom the entire time. At the end of the novel, Jim is finally set free and Huck ponders his next adventure away from civilization.", "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7e4cbd_8013717b4a35417bb50cc9979e9d3985.jpg/v1/fill/w_334,h_575,al_c,lg_1,q_80/7e4cbd_8013717b4a35417bb50cc9979e9d3985.webp"),
    ("Rosemary's Baby", "Ira Levin", "In Ira Levin’s classic horror novel Rosemary’s Baby (1967), a cult takes an unhealthy interest in a normal young couple who move into an apartment complex in New York City. The first book in the Rosemary’s Baby duology, it received an overwhelmingly positive reception following its release and later became a major motion picture. Levin, who died in 2007, was a prolific novelist and screenplay artist. His play Deathtrap is the longest-running comedy-thriller in Broadway history. Levin is best known for Rosemary’s Baby and for how the duology helped make horror books commercially successful.

The protagonist Rosemary Woodhouse is married to Guy Woodhouse. Rosemary and Guy recently purchased an apartment in the Bramford apartment building in New York. Everyone has heard rumors that the Bramford is haunted, and its bloody history makes it attractive and exclusive.

Guy is a struggling actor who barely makes any money. He gets small TV commercial and stage roles, but he has yet to make a big break. The couple never expects to live in the Bramford, even if it is a dream of theirs. When they finally receive a call offering them an apartment, they can barely contain their excitement.

Rosemary’s friend Hutch isn’t so sure about the Bramford. He warns the couple that witches, cults, cannibals, and Satanists live in the Bramford. The complex isn’t just haunted—it is cursed and attracts terrifying people. Back in the 1920s, locals called it the “Black Bramford.” People who went inside never came out again. Sure that Hutch is exaggerating, Rosemary doesn’t let his concerns deter her from moving in.

When Hutch realizes Rosemary won’t listen, he pleads with Guy to reason with her. He tells Guy that many residents commit suicide, go crazy, or join cults. Once, someone even found a dead baby in the basement. Guy refuses to listen to Hutch. He thinks that living in the Bramford will help him make connections and find better jobs.

Rosemary has other reasons for choosing the Bramford. She recently left her devout Catholic family and she wants to make it on her own. Guy isn’t a Catholic and her family is very disappointed in her life choices. Staying at the Bramford is just another way she can terrify and shock her conservative family.

Rosemary and Guy settle into their new apartment. Guy meets Minnie and Roman Castevet. The Castevets are an old couple that lives across the hall; Guy hits it off with them right away. Roman loves Broadway shows and movies, and Guy wiles away many hours talking to him about his acting ambitions. Rosemary wishes Guy spent more time looking for jobs.

Meanwhile, Rosemary makes her own friend—Terry, a girl who lives with the Castevets. A recovering heroin addict, Terry thanks the Castevets for everything they do for her. Without the Castevets, Terry would still be on the streets. Realizing that the Castevets are good neighbors, Rosemary befriends them, too.

Soon after Rosemary meets Terry, Terry throws herself out of an apartment window. Rosemary cannot understand why Terry did this, because she seemed stable; Guy tells her not to worry. Hutch, on the other hand, implores them to leave the Bramford. Much to Hutch’s despair, they refuse.

One morning, Rosemary wakes up naked and covered in scratches. She asks Guy what happened because she can’t remember anything. He says that he had sex with her while she slept because the Castevets told him Rosemary was fertile. Guy says that this was their best shot at having a baby.

Rosemary dreams of motherhood, and so Guy thinks he did what she wanted. Rosemary is angry and upset—not just because Guy had sex with her while she slept, but because she doesn’t remember the night before. She is now convinced that something is wrong with the Castevets, and she refuses to speak to them.

One by one, Rosemary’s memories return to her. She remembers that Guy brought the Castevets over for dinner. They fed her a chocolate mousse that she didn’t enjoy. The chocolate didn’t taste right. Guy made her eat it anyway, which is strange. She then remembers wearing a silky black robe and lying in a room surrounded by many naked people. Roman drew symbols on her belly using blood from a bowl.

As if these memories aren’t terrifying enough, Rosemary remembers more. She remembers the Castevets tying her down and the naked people dancing and chanting around her. Flute music played in the background the whole time. Guy had sex with her, but he was rough; it didn’t feel like her husband. She realizes that a demon possessed Guy and raped her.

The demon impregnated her. Rosemary is now carrying a demonic baby. Guy secures impressive roles in the theatre and attends talks with Hollywood agents. Everything is going well for him. Rosemary knows this is because he is working with the cult; they promised him fame if he let a demon use him. When Rosemary delivers her baby, she discovers the most terrifying truth of all—she is the mother of the Antichrist.", "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7e4cbd_65bc1bf1e4c24ba5982c5f9dcfa7cd9c.jpg/v1/fill/w_334,h_501,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/7e4cbd_65bc1bf1e4c24ba5982c5f9dcfa7cd9c.webp"),
    ("Moby Dick", "Herman Melville", "Moby Dick famously begins with the narratorial invocation “Call me Ishmael.” The narrator, like his biblical counterpart, is an outcast. Ishmael, who turns to the sea for meaning, relays to the audience the final voyage of the Pequod, a whaling vessel. Amid a story of tribulation, beauty, and madness, the reader is introduced to a number of characters, many of whom have names with religious resonance. The ship’s captain is Ahab, who Ishmael and his friend Queequeg soon learn is losing his mind. Starbuck, Ahab’s first-mate, recognizes this problem too, and is the only one throughout the novel to voice his disapproval of Ahab’s increasingly obsessive behavior. This nature of Ahab’s obsession is first revealed to Ishmael and Queequeg after the Pequod’s owners, Peleg and Bildad, explain to them that Ahab is still recovering from an encounter with a large whale that resulted in the loss of his leg. That whale’s name is Moby Dick. The Pequod sets sail, and the crew is soon informed that this journey will be unlike their other whaling missions: this time, despite the reluctance of Starbuck, Ahab intends to hunt and kill the beastly Moby Dick no matter the cost. Ahab and the crew continue their eventful journey and encounter a number of obstacles along the way. Queequeg falls ill, which prompts a coffin to be built in anticipation of the worst. After he recovers, the coffin becomes a replacement lifeboat that eventually saves Ishmael’s life. Ahab receives a prophecy from a crew member informing him of his future death, which he ignores. Moby Dick is spotted and, over the course of three days, engages violently with Ahab and the Pequod until the whale destroys the ship, killing everyone except Ishmael. Ishmael survives by floating on Queequeg’s coffin until he is picked up by another ship, the Rachel. The novel consists of 135 chapters, in which narrative and essayistic portions intermingle, as well as an epilogue and front matter.", "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7e4cbd_85482333eb4d47bb8f547d4f5556de64.png/v1/fill/w_334,h_451,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/7e4cbd_85482333eb4d47bb8f547d4f5556de64.webp"),
    ("Madame Bovary", "Gustave Flaubert", "Charles Bovary, the only son of a middle-class family, became a doctor and set up his practice in a rural village. He made a marriage of convenience with a woman older than himself. Upon his wife''s death, Bovary married an attractive young woman named Emma Roualt, the daughter of one of his patients. For a while Emma was excited and pleased by her marriage, but because of her superficial romantic ideals she was soon bored and disillusioned by her new life. As a result of her dissatisfaction she became ill.

For the sake of her health the Bovarys moved to a new town, where their daughter was born. Emma''s unhappiness continued, and she began to have romantic yearnings toward Leon, a young law clerk. After Leon left the town in order to attend law school, Emma''s boredom and frustration became more intense. She was negligent of her duties as a wife and mother. None of Bovary''s efforts to please her were successful, and she did not value or understand his devoted love for her.

Finally Emma had an adulterous affair with Rodolphe, a local landowner. When he abandoned her, she became seriously ill. After her recovery Emma encountered Leon in Rouen and began to carry on an affair with him. In order to afford weekly trips to the city to see Leon and to satisfy her other whims, Emma spent her husband''s money freely and incurred many debts. She kept these secret from Bovary and managed to obtain a Power of Attorney so that she would have full control over their financial affairs.

Eventually her unpaid bills went long overdue and a judgment was obtained against her by her creditors. She owed a vast sum of money, and the sheriff''s officers arrived to confiscate the family property. Emma tried frantically to raise the money and finally turned to both Rodolphe and Leon, but neither was willing or able to help. Out of shame and despair, she poisoned herself. Shortly afterwards her husband, now a ruined and broken man, also died, leaving their daughter to a life of poverty.", "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7e4cbd_f6ec6a156ccb4c42b808af2a7f4edf6d.jpg/v1/fill/w_334,h_508,al_c,lg_1,q_80/7e4cbd_f6ec6a156ccb4c42b808af2a7f4edf6d.webp"),
    ("The Little Match Girl", "Hans Christian Anderson", "“The Little Match Girl” is a sad story about a miserable young girl that touched the heart of many readers. The story begins on a cold winter night in which the snow never stopped. It was a real, rough and cold dinner.

This small poor girl is trying to sell matches because she was ordered to do so by a strict father. He didn’t allow her to come home until it would not be done, othervise she would get a beating. She tried to sell matches, but because of the cold, she died on the frozen sidewalk. She tried to warm up with the matches which she held in her hand. When she lit each one of them, it pointed to those events that she always dreamed of.

The most common was a dream of delicious food and warm clothing, but every time matches were extinguished, the magic would disappear. When she lit the last match, she saw her dead grandmother she loved very much and she eventually took her to heaven.

This is probably one of the saddest Andersen’s fairy tales set in the 19th century describing the unfortunate fate of a young child who is going through difficult times and dying of cold and hunger.", "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7e4cbd_668e9f40b8934d5f8d71ae026fd37285.jpg/v1/fill/w_334,h_432,al_c,lg_1,q_80/7e4cbd_668e9f40b8934d5f8d71ae026fd37285.webp");
